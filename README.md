#How The Internet Works

#What exactly is the Internet?

- The Internet, sometimes called simply "the Net," is a worldwide system of computer networks - a network of networks in
which users at any one computer can, if they have permission, get information from any other computer (and sometimes 
talk directly to users at other computers). 
- A global computer network providing a variety of information and communication facilities, consisting of 
interconnected networks using standardized communication protocols.

#Connecting to the Internet

There are many ways a user can connect to the Internet 

- Dial Up
    - May be outdated to certain people around the world.
    It is usually the slowest type of internet connection, which uses
    the phone-line, and this will prevent you from using the phone and the 
    Internet at the same time. 
    
- Broadband 

    The term broadband commonly refers to high-speed Internet access that is always on and faster than the traditional
    dial-up access. Broadband includes several high-speed transmission technologies such as:
    
    - DSL 
        - DSL is a wireline transmission technology that transmits data faster over traditional copper telephone lines 
        already installed to homes and businesses. DSL-based broadband provides transmission speeds ranging from several
        hundred Kbps to millions of bits per second (Mbps). The availability and speed of your DSL service may depend on
        the distance from your home or business to the closest telephone company facility.
         
    - Cable
        - Cable modem service enables cable operators to provide broadband using the same coaxial cables that deliver 
        pictures and sound to your TV set. Most cable modems are external devices that have two connections: one to the 
        cable wall outlet, the other to a computer. They provide transmission speeds of 1.5 Mbps or more.
   
    - Satellite 
        - Just as satellites orbiting the earth provide necessary links for telephone and television service, they can 
        also provide links for broadband. Satellite broadband is another form of wireless broadband, and is also useful 
        for serving remote or sparsely populated areas.
          
        Downstream and upstream speeds for satellite broadband depend on several factors, including the provider and 
        service package purchased, the consumerâ€™s line of sight to the orbiting satellite, and the weather. Typically a 
        consumer can expect to receive (download) at a speed of about 500 Kbps and send (upload) at a speed of about 
        80 Kbps. These speeds may be slower than DSL and cable modem, but they are about 10 times faster than the 
        download speed with dial-up Internet access. Service can be disrupted in extreme weather conditions.

#Whats URL and How Do You Read It?

- Uniform Resource Locator (URL) 
    
        The address of a specific website or file on the internet, like a home address

- An example of an URL

        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o8CwafCxnU
       
- HTTP 
    -
    - HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-layer protocol used primarily on the World Wide Web. 
    HTTP uses a client-server model where the web browser is the client and communicates with the webserver that hosts 
    the website. 
    
- WWW
    -
    - The World Wide Web (WWW) is a network of online content that is formatted in HTML and accessed via HTTP.

- Domain Name
    -
    - The part of a network address that identifies it as belonging to a particular domain.
        - The domain name for the URL in our example would be: "youtube"

- Top-level Domain 
    -
    - (TLD) is the last segment of the domain name. the TLD is the letters immediately following the final dot in an 
    internet address. A TLD identifies something about the website associated with it, such as its purpose, 
    the organization that owns it or the geographical area where it originates. Each TLD has a separate registry 
    managed by a designated organization under the direction of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers 
    (ICANN).
    - This is the highest level domain, The domain name would be second-level domain
    and www. would be subdomain.
        - The TLD for the example we have would be: ".com"

- Subpage
    -
    - the remaining sequence of letters/characters proceeding the TLD is considered a subpage, the path to a particular 
    file or webpage. 

#Web Server and HTTP Requests

A website is the way we see it, because it is pulling and get-requesting HTTP to a server to create the content of its page.

- TCP/IP
    - Transmission control protocol/Internet protocol, used to govern the connection of computer systems to the Internet.
    - TCP/IP specifies how data is exchanged over the internet by providing end-to-end communications that identify how it 
    should be broken into packets, addressed, transmitted, routed and received at the destination. TCP/IP requires 
    little central management, and it is designed to make networks reliable, with the ability to recover automatically 
    from the failure of any device on the network.
